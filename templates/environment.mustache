    MaPP collaborated with the <a href="http://bcmca.ca/" target="_blank">BC Marine Conservation Analysis (BCMCA)</a> to use Marxan to identify marine areas of high conservation value based on spatial datasets of ecological information (features). These Marxan scenarios can be used to inform the location or siting of PMZs. <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/marxan/" target="_blank">Marxan</a> is a decision support tool developed by the University of Queensland to provide solutions which capture a specified amount (target) of individual features for the least cost. The cost layer used for these Marxan runs was solely based on area. Based on relatively simple mathematical algorithms and equations, Marxan searches millions of potential solutions to find the best balance between costs and benefits. These MaPP Marxan solutions minimize the overall area subject to the constraint of meeting specified “targets” for all ecological features.
  <p>
  <p>
    MaPP consulted the MaPP Science Advisory Committee (SAC) for advice on scenarios and target selection. The SAC supported the decision to use the percentage target categories established by the BCMCA project team in 2006. Please see this <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1764986/BCMCA-Marxan for MaPP-Report on initial scenarios_27Feb2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013 BCMCA report</a> for more information about the MaPP-BCMCA project and Marxan scenarios, and consult the <a href="http://bcmca.ca" target="_blank">BCMCA Atlas</a> for detailed information about targets, species, and habitats.
