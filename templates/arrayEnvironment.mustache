            When selecting sites for PMZs, consider the location of Important Marine Areas for marine mammals, fish and birds. To reduce potential conflicts between human uses and marine species when siting SMZs, consider these Important Marine Areas for marine mammals, fish and birds.

            Important Areas were identified during the process of establishing Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) by the <a href="http://pncima.org/site/atlas.html" target="_blank"> Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA)</a>. Important Bird Areas (IBAs) were also identified by Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada, in partnership with BirdLife International.  Critical Habitat meets Canada's Species at Risk (SARA) requirements. Potential critical is insufficient information to meet SARA requirements. See the PNCIMA atlas for more information. See data layers for more information.  Data sources: up to 2009.

    MaPP collaborated with the <a href="http://bcmca.ca/" target="_blank">BC Marine Conservation Analysis (BCMCA)</a> to identify marine areas of high conservation value based on spatial datasets of ecological information. These Marxan scenarios can be used to inform the location or siting of MaPP zones. <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/marxan/" target="_blank">Marxan</a> is a decision support tool developed by the University of Queensland to provide solutions to the “minimum set problem” - capturing a specified amount (target) of individual features for the least cost. Based on relatively simple mathematical algorithms and equations, Marxan searches millions of potential solutions to find the best balance between costs and benefits. In short, Marxan solutions minimize the overall cost subject to the constraint of meeting specified “targets” for all features.
  </p>
  <p>
    MaPP consulted the MaPP Science Advisory Committee (SAC) for advice on scenarios and target selection.  The SAC supported the decision to use the percentage target categories established by the BCMCA project team in 2006. Please see this <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1764986/BCMCA-Marxan for MaPP-Report on initial scenarios_27Feb2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013 BCMCA report</a> for more information about the MaPP-BCMCA project and Marxan scenarios, and consult the <a href="http://bcmca.ca" target="_blank">BCMCA Atlas</a> for detailed information about targets, species, and habitats.
