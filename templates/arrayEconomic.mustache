          Existing marine activities should be considered when identifying areas for protection or special management.  This report summarizes the commercial fisheries which occur within the boundaries of the zone/collection based on the most recent available spatial data.  The spatial data is in the form of multi-year amalgamated 4km x 4km or 10km x 10km catch/effort grid data or, in the case of the salmon fishery, salmon catch estimate areas. The years which are represented by the data are noted following the name of the commercial fishery. NOTE: Not all catch and effort is represented by the spatial data.  Due to confidentiality restrictions a minimum of three vessels must be reporting within a given grid cell for it to be included.

  <h4>Overlap with Recreation Visitation <a href="#" data-toggle-node="52a775e23c2042124b004fa4" data-visible="false">show inVEST layer</a></h4>

    The Recreation & Tourism SMZs in this collection have an average recreational relative importance of <strong>{{investAvgRecValue}}.</strong> Values across the MaPP region range from 0 to 4.8, with higher numbers indicating greater recreation value.

    Recreation and tourism are important components of many national and local economies and they contribute in innumerable ways to physical wellbeing, learning, and quality of life. To quantify the value of natural environments, theÂ InVEST recreation model predicts the spread of person-days of recreation. In the absence of empirical data on visitation, the InVEST model uses a proxy for visitation: geotagged photographs posted to the website flickr.  The InVEST tool computes the total annual days that a user took at least one photograph within each cell, then returns to users the average annual number of photo-user-days from 2005-2012
